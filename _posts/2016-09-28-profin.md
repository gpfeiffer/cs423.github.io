## Introduction

Profinite groups are **Hausdorff compact** and **totally disconnected**
**topological groups**.

They are determined by their finite images under continuous homomorphisms:
a profinite group is the **inverse limit** of its finite images.

For an abstract (infinite) group $G$, the normal subgroups of finite index give rise to a topology on $G$.
The  completion of $G$ with respect to this topology
is  a profinite group, the **profinite completion** of $G$.

Profinite groups appear naturally as the Galois groups of infinite
Galois field extensions.

The first comprehensive account on profinite groups was given in

Mathematics <b>5</b>, Springer, Berlin 1964.

## Inverse Limits (aka Projective Limits)

# Basic Concepts

**Definition.** A set $I = (I, \leq)$ is a **directed poset** if
$\leq$ is a **partial order** on $I$ (that is a reflexive, transitive and
antisymmetric binary relation) and if $\leq$ is **directed**: for each
$i, j \in I$ there is a $k \in I$ with $i, j, \leq k$.

**Examples.** ![three].
$(\mathbb{N}, \leq)$.
The subgroup lattice of a finite group $G$ with respect to $\subseteq$.

**Note.** Any poset $(I, \leq)$ (directed or not) is a **category**,
with objects $I$ and morphisms $i \to j$ if $i \leq j$.  An **inverse
system** over a directed poset $I$ in a category $C$ is a
**contravariant functor** $F \colon I \to C$.

**Definition.** An **inverse system of topological spaces** over a
directed poset $I$ is a collection $\\{X_i: i \in I\\}$ of topological
spaces with continuous maps $\phi_{ij} \colon X_i \to X_j$, for $i
\geq j$ (!), such that $\phi_{ii} = \mathtt{id}_{X_i}$ and the diagram
![cd1] commutes for all $i \geq j \geq k$.

**Examples.** The constant inverse system on $I$ has $X_i = X$
and $\phi_{ij} = \mathtt{id}_X$ for all $i,j \in I$.

An example of an inverse system of finite groups is given by $I =
\mathbb{N}$, $p$ prime, $G_i = \mathbb{Z}/p^i \mathbb{Z}$ and
$\phi_{ij} \colon n + p^i \mathbb{Z} \mapsto n + p^j \mathbb{Z}$. This
is an inverse system of finite groups.

**Definition.** Suppose $Y$ is a topological space with continuous
maps $\psi_i \colon Y \to X_i$, $i \in I$.  The maps $\psi_i$ are
called **compatible** if the diagram ![cd2] commutes, for all $i, j
\in I$.

**Note.** In general, such an object $Y$ with compatible maps $\psi_i$
in a categroy $C$ is called a **cone** to the functor $F \colon I \to
C$.  An inverse limit is a **universal cone**.

**Definition.** A topological space $X$ with compatible maps $\phi_i
\colon X \to X_i$ is **an inverse limit** of the inverse system
$\\{X_i\\}$ if it satisfies the following **universal property**: for
all spaces $Y$ with compatible maps $\psi_i \colon Y \to X_i$, there
is a **unique** continuous map $\psi \colon Y \to X$ such that the diagram
![cd3] commutes, for all $i \in I$.

**Notation.** $X = \mathop{\varprojlim}\limits_{i \in I} X_i = \varprojlim X_i$.
The maps $\phi_i \colon X \to X_i$ are called **projections**.

# Inverse Limits Exist and are Unique

**Proposition.**  Let $(X_i, \phi_{ij}, I)$ be an inverse system.

(a) If $(X, \phi_i)$ and $(Y, \psi_i)$ are both inverse limits of
$\\{X_i\\}$ then there exists a unique **homeomorphism** $\psi \colon Y
\to X$ such that the diagram ![cd3] commutes, for all $i \in I$.

(b) The set $X = \\{(x_i) \in \prod X_i : x_i^{\phi_{ij}} = x_j\\}$
with $\phi_j \colon X \to X_j$, $(x_i) \mapsto x_j$ is an inverse limit of
$\\{X_i\\}$. (Here $\prod X_i$ is equipped with the **product topology**, and
$X$ with the **subspace topology**.)

**Proof.** (a) By the definition of an inverse limit, there exist continuous maps $\phi \colon X \to Y$ and $\psi \colon Y \to X$ such that the diagram
![cd4] commutes, for all $i \in I$.  Clearly, the diagram ![cd5] commutes.
But as the map $X \to X$ is unique, it follows that
$\phi \psi = \mathtt{id}_X$.
Similarly, $\psi \phi = \mathtt{id}_X$. Hence $\phi$ and $\psi$ are continuous
inverses of each other.

(b) It is easy to check that
* the $\phi_i$ are continuous,
* the $\phi_i$ are compatible (by construction),
* $X$ is universal: if $(Y, \psi_i)$ is a compatible cone, then
$\psi \colon Y \to X$ defined by $\psi(y) = (\psi_i(y))$ is continous,
and unique as any map $\psi' \colon Y \to X$ with
$\psi' \phi_i = \psi_i$, for all $i \in I$, clearly satisfies
$\psi'(y)_i = \psi_i(y) = \psi(y)_i$.
