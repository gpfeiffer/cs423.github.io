## Introduction

Profinite groups are Hausdorff compact and totally disconnected
topological groups.

They are determined by their finite images under continuous homomorphisms:
a profinite group is the **inverse limit** of its finite images.

For an abstract (infinite) group $G$, the normal subgroups of finite index give rise to a topology on $G$.
The  completion of $G$ with respect to this topology
is  a profinite group, the **profinite completion** of $G$.

## Inverse Limits

# Basic Concepts

A set $I = (I, \leq)$ is a **directed poset** if $\leq$ is a partial
order on $I$ (reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric) and if
$\leq$ is **directed**: for each $i, j \in I$ there is a $k \in I$ with
$i, j, \leq k$.

**Examples.** ![three].
$(\mathbb{N}, \leq)$.
The subgroup lattice of a finite group $G$ with respect to $\subseteq$.

**Note.** Any poset $(I, \leq)$ (directed or not) is a **category**,
with objects $I$ and morphisms $i \to j$ if $i \leq j$.  An **inverse
system** over a directed poset $I$ in a category $C$ is a
**contravariant functor** $F \colon I \to C$.

An **inverse system of topological spaces** over a directed poset $I$
is a collection $\\{X_i: i \in I\\}$ of topological spaces
with continuous maps
$\phi_{ij} \colon X_i \to X_j$, for $j \leq i$ (!),
such that
$\phi_{ii} = \mathtt{id}_{X_i}$ and the diagram ![cd1] commutes
for all $k \leq j \leq i$.

**Example.** The constant inverse system on $I$ has $X_i = X$
and $\phi_{ij} = \mathtt{id}_X$ for all $i,j \in I$.

**Example.** $I = \mathbb{N}$, $p$ prime, $G_i = \mathbb{Z}/p^i \mathbb{Z}$
and $\phi_{ij} \colon n + p^i \mathbb{Z} \mapsto  n + p^j \mathbb{Z}$. This is an inverse system of finite groups.

Suppose $Y$ is a topological space with continuous maps $\psi_i \colon Y \to X_i$, $i \in I$.  The maps $\psi_i$ are called **compatible** if [...] commutes

**Note.** In general, such an object $Y$ with compatible maps $\psi_i$ in a categroy $C$ is called a **cone** to the functor $F \colon I \to C$.  An inverse limit is a **universal cone**.

A topological space $X$ with compatible maps $\phi_i \colon X \to X_i$
is **an inverse limit** of the inverse system $\\{X_i\\}$ if
it satisfies the following **universal property**: for all spaces $Y$ with compatible maps $\psi_i \colon Y \to X_i$,
there is a **unique** continuous map $\psi \colon Y \to X$
such that [...] commutes.

**Notation.** $X = \mathop{\varprojlim}\limits_{i \in I} X_i = \varprojlim X_i$.
The maps $\phi_i \colon X \to X_i$ are called **projections**.

# Inverse Limits Exist and are Unique

**Proposition.**  Let $(X_i, \phi_{ij}, I)$ be an inverse system.

(a) If $(X, \phi_i)$ and $(Y, \psi_i)$ are both inverse limits of $\\{X_i\\}$
then there exists a unique homeomorphism $\psi \colon Y \to X$ such that [...] commutes.

(b) The set $X = \\{(x_i) \in \prod X_i : x_i^{\phi_{ij}} = x_j\\}$
with $\phi_i \colon X \to X_i$, $(x_i) \mapsto x_i$ is an inverse limit of
$\\{X_i\\}$.

**Proof.** (a) Diagrams.

(b) It is easy to check that
