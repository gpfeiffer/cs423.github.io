**Graphs.**

A _graph_ consists of a collection of objects, called _nodes_ or _vertices_,
with certain pairs of nodes connected by links called _edges_.

Example: ...

In this simple setting, two nodes are either connected or not (that is, there are no multiple links) and if node $x$ is connected to node $y$, then it is also true that $y$ is connected to $x$: the edges set up a _symmetric_ relationship between nodes.  If we want to express more complex relationships (asymmetric, multiple edges) we need to use the more complex structure of _directed graphs, possibly with multiple edges.

    A graph can serve as a mathematical model of a network.
